(Prediction of Heavy Ion Charge State Ratios and Elemental Composition of Solar Wind Using Deep Learning)

Following the research project carried out during the internship period at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) 

from June to August 2025, this research paper is currently in **preparation for submission**. 

The Korean Society of Space Science (KASI) announced the first results of the research process, and the research data, analysis, and all processes are being studied through continuous experiments.

In line with the research direction, the data preprocessing is being modified several times.

After pre-processing, I posted the code that generates data for analysis and the conference presentation pdf,

If you are interested, please refer to it.

After finishing the research, I would like to post the code that I finally organized. Thank you.
